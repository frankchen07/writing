Hey, I'm [Frank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankchen07/).

I'm currently on sabbatical. This particular adventure started with living abroad in France in 2024 and has morphed into various experiments to change the shape of my life. You can follow my journey on [my newsletter](https://fronk.substack.com/).

Lately, I've gravitated towards activities and topics about seeking beauty, mastering crafts, and improving taste. I'm in the process of creating a magazine of essays alongside a published author and trying my hand at ceramics. I'm also tastefully rehauling my wardrobe. 😌

Just prior, I helped build the foundations of a more private internet with [Aleo](https://provable.com/) and a product to fund Ethereum public goods with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co). In a past life, I played around with numbers as an analyst, but eventually shifted over to telling stories in the realm of [products](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/map-of-content-(product)).

I do a fuck ton of [jiujitsu](https://www.instagram.com/frankthetankjj/) and consider it an obsession that has altered the way I think about [mindset](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/map-of-content-(mindset)), [learning, training, and strategy](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/map-of-content-(jiujitsu)).

I'm into a fair amount of [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/fronkfeeds/) as well. [I did some food science blogging, hosted experimental supper clubs](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/map-of-content-(cooking)), and [worked at a 2* Michelin restaurant](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/working-at-a-2-michelin-star-restaurant). The hospitality space continues to inspire me from a technological and cultural standpoint, and continually reminds me to be "unreasonably hospitable" because it keeps us human.

You can find my thought snippets below in reverse alphabetical order, or use the links in the paragraphs above to heuristically stumble around. Enjoy!
