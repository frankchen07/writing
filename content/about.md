hey i'm frank

i'm currently on sabbatical

this adventure started with [**living abroad in france in 2024**](https://fronk.substack.com/t/paris), [**finding lost relatives in china**](https://fronk.substack.com/t/asia), and has morphed into various experiments to change the shape of my life

not too long ago, i broke into hopsitality [**working at 2\* Michelin restaurant Birdsong SF**](https://fronk.substack.com/t/michelin) and am currently obsessed about [**craft coffee**](https://fronk.substack.com/t/coffee)

i do an obscene amount of jiujitsu too and consider it an obsession that has altered the way i think about teaching, competing, training, struggling, and learning

i share these stories at [**longform jiujitsu**](https://longformjiujitsu.substack.com)

also, i think stories are really important, so i recently [**published a zine of essays**](https://pathless.metalabel.com/unwritten?variantId=2) for those rewriting the rules of work and life

lastly, i'm also helping to educate folks on [**organizing their personal finances**](https://misemoney.substack.com)
