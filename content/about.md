hey i'm frank

i'm currently on sabbatical

this adventure started with living abroad in france in 2024 and has morphed into various experiments to change the shape of my life

you can follow along on at [frank's newsletter](https://fronk.substack.com/)

i also do an obscene amount of jiujitsu and consider it an obsession that has altered the way i think about teaching, competing, training, struggling, and learning

i share these stories at [longform jiujitsu](https://longformjiujitsu.substack.com)

my latest experiments include [working at a 2* Michelin restaurant](https://fronk.substack.com/p/dont-fuck-with-the-duck)and publishing [a zine of stories and essays](https://pathless.metalabel.com/unwritten?variantId=2) for those rewriting the rules of work and life

my past experiences in crypto, product, and hospitality have taught me to be resourceful, service-oriented, and empathetic towards customers

crypto encouraged me to embrace weirdness and develop persistence alongside innovation

hospitality shuttled my attention to the customer experience and refined my ability to be observant, iterative, and detail-obsessive

i continually strive to integrate these philosophies into everything i do

as for the future, i’m currently continuing my experiments and exploring how my skills play into the world of craft coffee, hospitality tech, and deep technology
