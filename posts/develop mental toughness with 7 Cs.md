### develop mental toughness with 7 Cs

- Competitive - Competitors take bad breaks and use them to drive themselves just that much harder. Quitters take bad breaks and use them as reasons to give up.

- Confidence - Confident athletes have a can-do attitude, a belief they can handle whatever comes their way. They almost never fall victim to self-defeating thoughts. Jordan said he went into every game believing he was the best player on the court until someone proved otherwise.

- Control - Successful athletes are able to control their emotions and behavior. They focus on what they can control and don't allow things that are out of their control to affect them.

- Committed - Mentally tough athletes focus their time and energy on their goals, process, and dreams.

* Composure - How an athlete manages their emotions can determine whether they win or lose.

* Courage - Only climbers get to the top.

* Consistency - Athletes who stick with a schedule do so through good times and bad.
