**What I've been up to:**

This week I'm typing from Bozeman, Montana. The company I work for scheduled an offsite here, so I'm freezing my ass off walking around outside on black ice and snowy roads. 

**What I've been reading:**

I haven't been doing as much reading as I want but I've been perusing articles from Paul Millerd's [site](https://think-boundless.com/writing/). He's the author of "The Pathless Path" that I was reading a while ago. 

**What I've been watching:**

"Poker Face" on Peacock. It's about a girl with an impeccable bullshit detector and goes around accidentally being curious and solving crimes. Every new episode is a new crime.

**Cool thing I found:**

Apparently Butte, Montana has the longest standing Chinese restaurant in the United States, called Pekin Noodle Parlor (est. 1909). While eating breakfast with the work gang, there were half-jokes about illegally hopping on trains to go eat there. At the time, our group was sitting down at Western Cafe, another long-time establishment (est. 1943) serving up heart-attack diner food.  

There's something very soulful about a business that's passed down the generations. It might not be modern and hip, but it sure is comfy and historical, and that's a vibe I can get behind.  
  
**Latest idea I've had:**  
  
Double layer cr√®me br√ªl√©e. I had a cr√®me br√ªl√©e last night. Done right, there's the super nice crispy ice skating rink of sugar on top of soft sweet custard, but I've always thought the custard base wasn't deep enough. I want a voluminous scoop of custard. So, how about a deeper dish of cr√®me br√ªl√©e but with a layer of crunchy sugar in the middle and on top?

"But Frank, that's basically two cr√®me br√ªl√©es stacked on top of each other." 

Yes. And what if someone made a large enough cr√®me br√ªl√©e that I could skate on top? If I fall in, I get to eat my way out.
