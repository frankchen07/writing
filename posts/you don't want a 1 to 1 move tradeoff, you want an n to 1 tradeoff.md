### you don't want a 1 to 1 move tradeoff, you want an n to 1 tradeoff

Chael Sonnen talks about tempo in a way where it's like strategic moves in a chess match. You don't want your opponent to make one move for your one move, you want your opponent to make one move only after you've made two, three, or more.

Create this dynamic, and you will stay ahead of your opponent.
