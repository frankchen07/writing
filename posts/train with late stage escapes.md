### train with late stage escapes

Note: this is to be done in a training environment focused on skill acquisition.

When you obtain a submission, don't just rip it. Allow your opponent to try late stage escapes. It gives your opponent the ability to practice a late stage escape, and it gives you the ability to figure out how to adjust and finish while reacting to the late escape.
