### observing that your attention is elsewhere is coming back to the present

When doing meditation or any activity where you suddenly realize that your thoughts are drifting to the future or past, *that* acknowledgement is a conscious movement towards coming back to the now. 

Trust that staying present and experiencing the state of "being" is all you need to to be successful in your endeavors.
