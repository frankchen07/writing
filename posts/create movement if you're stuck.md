### create movement if you're stuck

There are no static movements. There are static positions but transitions and transitory movements must occur to cycle through these static positions.

Transitory movements are an opportunity for one to move around their opponent, to attack or to defend, but the most common use of transitory movements is to cause movement, kuzushi (off-balance), or a reaction. 

When your opponent is transitioning to another static position or responding to a transitory movement you have initiated, you can then initiate your own movement to capitalize on the time it takes them to recover, whether it's their balance, the momentum of their movement, or their failed attack.

As an example, even if you have the beginnings of a heel hook, you still have to initiate a transitory roll in order to fully expose and catch the heel. 

Create movement, and that will generate openings.
