### pair offensive actions on the offbeat

In music, there is "time", where the simplest of beats are counted off in 4s. In 4/4 time, these would be quarter notes. 

Opportunities and avenues for offensive action come on the offbeat, which can occur within eighth notes. So quarter notes,

> 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4

become one "and" two "and", and on, usually denoted with "+"s.

> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4

If an attack and a corresponding defense happens on the on-beat, 1 would be an offensive attack, 2 would be an opposing defense, and the "and" (+) beat of the 2nd quarter note (two-and) would represent the opportune time to attack and have a mover's advantage on your opponent. 

Perhaps it's overthinking. Make a reaction and follow through.
