### constant movement is better than being static

Notice where and when you're freezing and replace that static moment with movement. Even if you move incorrectly, adjust. Movement is a safer bet as compared to being static. Just go. Keep moving.

When visualizing jiujitsu phrasing in your head it's always a pattern of continuous movement. Higher belts know how to move and flow in and out of positions. 

- What is next? 
- What is next?
- What is next?

Don't stop until you get to a chill zone.

If you're thinking it, just fire and figure it out later. At the very least you complete some cycles and get better.
