### the magic of the experience (michelin part 7)

_This is a re-sharing of a culinary experience that I had back in 2022, working at a 2* Michelin restaurant, Birdsong SF. I posted an eight-part series on Twitter at the time, but it was never formalized in a longer format. I'm doing this to sort of immortalize the experience here since it was some of my earliest beginnings of living according to my values, doing what I found interesting, and finding beauty._

_It's an experience that helped shape my first sabbatical and I'm revisiting some of these learnings as they mix with conversations and readings in my current sabbatical._

_Each part will be about the same with some grammatical and intonation fixes, plus an updated reflection at the end._

_This is part seven. Enjoy_ 😌.

Some of my friends have asked "has working at the 2-star restaurant ruined the magic of dining there? Would you go back to eat there?"

It's a nuanced answer, not a simple yes or no. I'd say that the magic was replaced by narratives. And like learning a language, it's a one way street. Once you learn it, you can no longer hear gibberish.

Inherent in the word "magic" is the fact that you don't have a working explanation for why something occurs. Once I gathered more context by being in the trenches with the people who work with the food day in and day out, I was able to build narratives around the unknowns.

This lessens the magic in a way where the unknowns become more known. When you're operating more in the realm of knowns rather than unknowns, you have more explanations, and therefore less magic.

When I return to eat, I'll have a hard bias to shake. I won't be able to separate the narratives of the kitchen and the artistry of the food. They would be one and the same. I won't be able to view the dishes in isolation anymore.

Instead, I would see stories.

Stories of the time we almost ran out of peas and the executive sous was downstairs prepping them as fast as we were serving them (clutch 💪🫛).

Stories of the CDC staying up until 3 am, experimenting and perfecting that super-duper-special-occasion hazelnut soufflé. 😋

Stories of the heroic dishwashers that somehow keep the entire night going, dishing out (pun intended) clean plates for the guests. 🐙

Stories of the unseen commis downstairs ravaging through hundreds of pounds of produce, washing, cleaning, picking, prepping, and working faster than I could ever imagine (or keep up). 🔨🌿🌱🍄🐟

And of course, the stories of each dish - layers upon layers of flavors that were carefully coaxed into perfect bites. 🥘

For me, the magic has morphed into a vast well of awe and wonder. And because of my experience, it's always served with a side dish of humble appreciation.
