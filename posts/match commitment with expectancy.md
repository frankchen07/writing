### match commitment with expectancy

Wanting is conscious. Expecting is unconscious and requires a follow through on a commitment but it won't automatically mean you will win or conquer. However, without expectancy, you also don't have the staying power when shit hits the fan.

Have a strong sense of expectancy but focus on the process now to reduce the pressure when things don't go your way. 

An example that Mark gives in his book: 

"When asked if people could achieve high stock returns right after a class, only 1/100 people raised their hand. When asked if they could bake a lemon cake after being presented a recipe, almost everyone raised their hand. The question for the stock scenario is "why didn't I raise my hand?" It reflects your true belief that you can actually do something."

Similarly, if I roll with a lower belt and ask, "can I submit this person?" I would raise my hand. If I roll with a competitive black belt and ask "can I submit this person?" I wouldn't raise my hand. But if I did raise my hand, even if I don't in the moment submit the black belt, I have infinitely more chance to do so in the now and in the present. 

In order to build this expectancy:

* revisit and feel-imagery past successes
* select for positive experiences over negative ones
* ensure your commitment is on par with your expectancy
* enjoy the present process
