### training habits are competition habits

When you engage, don't miss out on the fact that you are developing habits in the training room. 

Don't just walk into people's guard.

Don't accept bottom, unless the guard is what you're playing.

Don't accept failure of the goals you are trying to achieve in that particular training session.

If you can get up, get up. If you can shoot, shoot. If you can turtle, turtle. If you can get head and hip height to get on top, then do that. Develop that muscle in the training room because then, it will be the default muscle in competition.
