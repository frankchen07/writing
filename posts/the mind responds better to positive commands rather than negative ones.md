### the mind responds better to positive commands rather than negative ones

Give positive commands and impose decisive action. 

The mind is an association machine and it responds better to positive commands. A simple example is when someone tells you "don't think about white elephants". What's the first thing your'e going to do? Think about white elephants. In order to not think about white elephants, you have to give a positive command and think about red cars. The mental imagery in your head then shifts.

With a jiujitsu example, if you tell yourself "don't get heel hooked", your brain automatically associates that command with getting heel hooked, which is the exact opposite of what you wanted. Instead, say "I will slip my heel and counter leg lock them", or "I will [defend and counter]". When your mind is experiencing a positive command or an imposing action statement, it is impossible to experience a negative thought.
