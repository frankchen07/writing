### focusing on breathing brings me back to the present

Focusing on deep diaphragm breathing until it is second nature helps me bring myself back to the present.

In the jiujitsu context, this helps me achieve a "relaxed poise", and further opens up a "sense of play" which helps me to stay focused at the problems at hand and away from anger.

At the very least, it opens the door to feeling loose and dangerous. I might even feel bold enough to embody a gangsta swagger that ups my subconscious game.
