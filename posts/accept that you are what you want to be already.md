### accept that you are what you want to be already

Identify with who and what you are capable of to create a strong self image.

Although it is difficult to measure, having a negative self-image hampers the activation of your subconscious, which hampers performance. Self-image resists change and can drastically impact performance. Consciously be the self-image you want. This will require working with direct affirmations and replacing your old self-image with your new self-image. If it helps, you can imagine taking the essence of your favorite jiujitsu players.

* beyond capable of great performances
* have sick, flowy, tricky, expressive jiujitsu
* hard to submit, slippery as fuck
* have fire leg locks and leg game
* going to get out of mount, and submit this mf
* a cold-blooded submission hunter
* going to get cross-ashi double trouble and submit this mf
* a wrestle up guard player
* going to come up and get my points
* an open guard float passer
* going to cut through pass you and consolidate position
* identify with champions you like
* it is me to perform very well in competition
