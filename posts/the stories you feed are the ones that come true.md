### the stories you feed are the ones that come true

There's this constant battle of two stories in my head - "Frank, yeah, he never seemed to find his competition stride, and eventually, he fizzled out," and "Frank, yeah, he finally hit his stride and now he's taking out the competition left and right."

The story you feed and the story you visualize is the one that will come true. You manifest your subconscious to pull you towards your goal.

The more you repeat something in your head, the more it becomes true. Your attitude determines your altitude. If you think you can, or if you think you can't, you're probably right. The choice is yours. 

It's a lack of faith that makes people afraid of meeting challenges. To be great you have to believe you're already great. If you don't, pretend that you do.
