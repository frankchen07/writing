### leg lock curriculum

#### straight ankle finishing mechanics
1. control the joint above (hip / knee) concept
2. fulcrum around the achilles heel
3. lever on the toes

#### straight ankle offense
- attacking from single leg x
- attacking after repummel to underside ashi or step-over ashi
- attacking the belly down finish

#### straight ankle defense
1. boot
2. push to shift the fulcrum
3. come up or strip grips

#### straight ankle situationals
- defending from standing slx
- defending from sitting slx
- defending repummels

#### the leg entanglements
- single leg x (irimi ashi)
	- attack straight ankle
	- attack outside heel hook
	- attack inside heel hook
- legs locked inside of opponent's legs
	- attack inside heel hook using the saddle or cross ashi
		- special case using the criss-cross ashi
	- attack outside heel hook (crippler or diagonal ashi)
	- special case (far hip ashi)
- legs locked outside of opponent's legs
	- attack inside heel hook (50/50)
		- special cases (80/20, 70/30, 90/10 or outside sankaku)
	- attack outside heel hook (double outside ashi)

#### understanding heel hook mechanics
1. mechanically, what is happening?
	- opposing forces causing ligament tears
	- straight and bent leg concepts
	- dorsiflexion concepts
2. using your legs to control the joint above (hip and thigh)
	- using closing of your own legs to turn defensive man's leg
3. t-rex arm mechanics to expose, dorsiflex, and catch the heel
	- elbow scrape to rib, minimize distance
	- false grip or wristwatch
	- gable or butterfly grip
	- suck to chest, chin to chest
	- rest on outside of elbow
	- chest weight over heel
4. combining to create
	- rotational finishes
	- lateral finishes
	- rotational and lateral maximum damage finishes
- use saddle/cross ashi/criss-cross ashi to demonstrate concepts/finish
- use outside ashi with heel captured to demonstrate concepts/finish

#### understanding heel hook defense 
- understanding when and how you are safe to stay in the pocket
- understanding importance of knee positioning and knee line
- understanding the concept of the secondary leg and hip movement

1. get secondary leg back
2. ballerina toes and slip
	- late escape addition - fight the hands
	- late escape addition - extension and push into shoulder
	- late escape addition - contraction and pull up onto elbow
3. escape the knee line

- use saddle/cross ashi to demonstrate concepts and defend
- use outside ashi with heel captured to demonstrate concepts and defend

#### cross ashi (saddle)
- offensive & defensive man situationals
- offense
	- standard offense mechanics
	- capturing the secondary leg and resulting entanglements
	- exposing the heel
		- pressure to back of the knee using a backheel
		- false grip and knee pit
	- rolling with your opponent
	- special case: fair hip ashi
	- special case: diagonal ashi (crippler)
- defense
	- standard defense mechanics
	- freeing the secondary leg and defending
	- honey stick counter
	- hiding the heel mid-roll
	
#### double outside ashi (doa)
- offensive & defensive man situationals
- offense
	- reaping from slx and using far hip ashi while rolling solves a lot of outside heel exposure issues
	- stopping the roll 
- defense 
	- coming up and smashing
	- backstep escape to grip strip or wedge backtake

#### 50/50
- dangers of 50/50
- sequences for having your heel exposed
- sequences for having your opponents heel exposed
- getting to 80/20 and 90/10 / outside sankaku
- what outside positioning offers over inside positioning
- heel exposure by facing the knee
- unlocking the feet 
- having good structure
- inverting to capture the heel
- backside 50/50
