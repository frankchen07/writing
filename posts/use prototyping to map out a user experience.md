### use prototyping to map out a user experience

Prototyping in the early stages is not necessarily an MVP.

You don't build unfinished items on the way when you're prototyping. You build complete items that are nascent in idea, but complete and simulated in the end experience. 

1. What is the concept?
2. What is an assumption that is core to your product that you want to validate?
3. What do you need to prototype in order to validate that assumption?
