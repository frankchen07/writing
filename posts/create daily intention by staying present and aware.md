### create daily intention by staying present and aware

 When you have intention, you are living it all day, every day. You don't just have a goal; you are truly committing to maintaining an awareness of self-actualizing the very best version of yourself.

 Many people have auto-neurotic kickoff, where the day is taken adrift by external stimuli around them. When this happens you set yourself up to have an aimless, stressful day. 

1. Prime your day by visualizing. Box breathe.
2. Continually check in and see what your mind is saying throughout the day.
3. Honest reflection and assessment.
