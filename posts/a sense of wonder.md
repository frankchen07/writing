I'm re-reading @p_millerd's "The Pathless Path" again, reflecting on my year of finding energy.

There are things I didn't do right the first time.

Specifically, how one uses "a sense of wonder" to override the coping mechanisms that we dream up to make work life more bearable.

He defines it as "the state of being open to the world, its beauty and its potential possibilities", but how do we make that tangible?

I didn't experience any of this during my time off from work. I didn't feel like I had any large bursts of energy. There wasn't the dropping of the other shoe, some come-to-hither moment that drastically altered the course of my life. 

Instead I felt a quiet fizzling and inevitable stumbling back into the slipstream of what was "normal work".

So let's return to that definition of wonder. How else can we understand what that means?

I suspect it's less about doing and more about "being". It's some matrix mental shit that I'm only beginning to understand. 

Less about scheduling and more about spontaneity?
Less about tangibility and more about faith?
Less about goals and more about screwing around?

What else?
