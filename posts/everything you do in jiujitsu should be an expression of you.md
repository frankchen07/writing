### everything you do in jiujitsu should be an expression of you

Back in my bboying days, I heard and contemplated the often quoted "bboying is the ultimate method of expression." 

Movement is life, and the way my mind and body are constructed are uniquely mine. My DNA is mine and my upbringing is also mine. All of these nature and nuture components gives you individuality that no one can take from you.

Be wary of what you intake from others. Always assess if certain moves fit your game. If it doesn't, feel free to discard or modify so that it is yours. Just because a world champion executes an armbar one way doesn't necessarily mean it is the only way to do it.
