### caf√©s & people watching

"There's nothing more Parisian than sitting at a caf√© and watching the world pass on by."

Before France, I was already a fan of enjoying vibey coffee spots, but I didn't subscribe to people watching as much as I do now. I was always "doing" something, whether it be writing, work, or reading. 

Paris fixed that right quick. 

It's kinda hard to not people watch in Paris. When the late afternoon rolls around, you see flocks of patrons both young and old, sitting at various outdoor caf√©s scattered across the city, enjoying anything from an aperol spritz, espresso, or some bread and charcuterie. 

The caf√©s are pretty much set up in a way that facilitates people watching. All the chairs are faced outwards, and they really know how to squeeze you in like a can of sardines. You're pretty much going to be elbow to elbow with the table next to you, so get your friendship self ready because that's gonna happen. Introverts beware.

From the outside, because of the dense nature of all these chairs outside, it feels like you're being watched by a theater audience whenever you pass by a caf√©, so get your model walk ready. Le Bonaparte captures this essence really well. They've got a balling peanut gallery, not to mention a peppery saucisson and decent espresso. üòã Just make sure you bring some treats for your dog something too, otherwise:

It's actually a motivation to dress better too, since if you're being watched, you're being judged, and that means you want to look good and feel good. Especially when you have your weird looking dog in his slinky outfit, you better look presentable. Bring sunglasses too so you can stare right back at the peanut gallery without inciting hostilities or awkwardness. 

For the most part, people first looked at our oddly shaped jackal dog, and then their visual parameters would eventually give me and my partner the look-see, almost as if they were checking who the owners of such a ridiculous looking animal was. They maybe? were impressed to find two nicely dressed folks (proud to say people always tried talking to us in French), but weirdly so, because they don't look traditionally French and perhaps didn't look like a standard Asian tourists either. This is the beauty of people watching. They're creating backstories, curiosities, and snap judgements - I just did it right there for myself and it's the same thing I would do if I were the watcher. Even better than voyeurism.

Which brings me to my conclusion, which is that people watching is probably the ultimate form of travel. If you people watch carefully while you sit at caf√©s, well you can observe 100, maybe even 200 people in the course of several hours. You won't even need to travel anymore if you learn how to people watch. It's not their style of dress, it's their mannerisms, what they're talking about, how they act around others, and how they click into society at the current moment.

It's leisure, it's imaginative, it's curiosity. It keeps you connected to the world. Do more people watching today. 

Here's a people watching kit, just for you:

1. dress up nicely (doesn't have to be a suit or anything, also, has nothing to do with people watching, but you might as well be eye candy for someone else people watching you)
2. dog or partner or friend (optional, but ideally, they should stfu and also be people watching)
3. pick a vibey coffee spot that's bustling with people
4. sunglasses
5. sit, sip, judge, imagine backstories, and narrate for them because they're doing the same for you ü•∞

Special thanks to Ryan for all the pictures for this post that I was too lazy to take.
