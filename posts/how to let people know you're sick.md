### how to let people know you're sick

There's not much to an email like this. As long as you're not lying about it and playing hooky, people generally understand what's going on.

Hello team,

I'm not feeling well today and am running a fever. I'll be offline and recovering.

In the meantime, if you have any urgent requests, please reach out to [manager / teammate].

I'll respond as soon as I'm back on my feet again.
