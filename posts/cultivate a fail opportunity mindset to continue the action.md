### cultivate a fail opportunity mindset to continue the action

"Failure? Or opportunity? Let's face the facts - the overwhelming majority of moves you attempt in sparring or competition will fail. This is true regardless of your skill level. As you get better, so do your opponents. As you learn new moves, they learn new counters. If you try a hundred moves on a given days training you can expect ninety of them to fail. Given this fact, it's up to you to shift your perspective on failure. Even a failed move will elicit a defensive reaction from your opponent (indeed that defensive reaction is usually the reason why it failed). Your job is to use that defense reaction to set up the subsequent move(s) that succeed."

"Get rid of the fail-stop mentality that most people carry into jiujitsu and adopt the fail-opportunity mindset instead. If you stop every time you perceive failure then you really will fail. If you immediately switch to a follow up move appropriate to the defensive reaction you elicited from the initial failure, then (initial) failures will become one the main sources of your success. Every time you experience failure, have a follow up mapped out and suddenly you'll find that getting stopped one way by an opponent is just an invitation to a different route to success."

~ John Danaher

I really like the idea of adopting the "fail-opportunity" mindset instead of the "fail-stop" mindset, which allows us to flow better from opportunity to opportunity. This is similar to the [[don't be satisfied with only escaping]] mentality.
