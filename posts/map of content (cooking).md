### map of content (cooking)

I've done some food blogging over the years. One of my first blogs was a blog that focused on the science of cooking alongisde reviews of interesting restaurants that I hit up in Los Angeles and Europe. The blog is now over a decade old and deprecated, but you can see [some of the writing](https://github.com/frankchen07/ccaveman/tree/gh-pages/_posts) over at my Github.

Before the pandemic hit, I also started an experimental supper club, where I planned, tested, and executed three course meals based on ingredients chosen by my guests. You can check out my associated [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fronkfeeds/) and the [signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aYYu_tkTACkSo-4BK1JWPqLE4pS5UtmsZ6iqeiGYDa0/edit?usp=sharing) to get an idea of what these menus looked like. I had always been very curious about being a cook, a chef, and doing restaurant work, so I decided to create the experience for myself and [[test the waters before diving]]. Alongside the supper club was a newsletter I briefly started and wrote for. I've reconsituted some of the articles here below. The most pertinent ones are most likely the ones that talk more about intuitive cooking and using recipes as inspiration, rather than verbatim instructions. I've separated those out for your perusal, but some of the posts are prefaced with some supper club details.
