### prioritization should be simple

Instead of a prioritization framework, look at the desired outcomes.

1. Understand what the desired outcome is for your users.
2. Understand what their problem is.
3. Understand how many users are affected.
4. Understand why this particular experiment/project is valuable given the two constraints above.
5. Understand how you will measure success.
6. Use Teresa Torres's opportunity solution tree how many users are affected.
