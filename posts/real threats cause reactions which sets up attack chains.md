### real threats cause reactions which sets up attack chains

If you are going to feint in order to create a reaction, the threat has to be real. The attack must have substance in order to create a true reaction. 

If you just reach down and hit the knee, that's not a takedown threat. If you combine that reach out with a level change and a quick snap forward, your opponent will genuinely defend. That defense is a reaction. Read these reactions take advantage of them. If you stay in the experience, stay present, then you will be aware of these reactive opportunities.
