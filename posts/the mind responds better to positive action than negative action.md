### the mind responds better to positive action than negative action

"Land the ball ten yards to the right of the pin." You get what your mind sets. 

The mind works most effectively when you're telling it what to do rather than what not to do. 

However, you need to communicate to your subconscious by using the right language. In this case, it is not words, it is imagery and feeling, combined with non-judgmental observation of how it feels in the present. Imagine fluidly landing the ball ten yards to the right of the pin. Don't think in words when you perform the action. Your body will know.
