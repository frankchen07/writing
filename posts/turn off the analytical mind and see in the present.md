### turn off the analytical mind and see in the present

Play with your eyes, not with your ideas.

"I see the ball, I hit the ball."

Similarly, "I see the heel, I take the heel." This is the only thing that matters in the present moment. 

Lose your analytical mind, and play with what you see in front of you.
