Just a note - much of the linked examples here relate to my forays of mindset in the sport of jiujitsu.

The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey was one of the first sport psychology books that I read. He lays out what an athlete should do in order to stop over-analyzing and perform to their fullest ability. The TLDR is hard work and smart training imprints performance to the subconscious, and the way to activate it is for us to shut our conscious brain up and step out of the way. 

1. [[non judgmental observation shuts down emotions]]
2. [[visualized feel imagery is the subconscious language]]
3. [[experience in the present opens you to the language of opportunity]]
4. [[repeat non judgmental observation to assess the outcome]]

Many authors talk about the differentiation between the conscious and the subconscious mind. Our conscious mind is the one that we mostly experience on a day to day basis, but [[the subconscious is where true performance lies]].

In order to activate our subconscious, we need to understand how to communicate to it. Because the underlying processes are so automatic and subtle, we have to understand that [[the mind responds better to positive commands rather than negative ones]] and that [[visualization and feel imagery is the language of the subconscious]]. When we understand that this is how we talk to our subconscious, we can begin to affect the deeper parts of our psyche. 

There are mental exercises you can immediately partake in. The first is to [[accept that you are being what you want to be already]]. This involves a level of self-identifying with some future self, but instead of seeing it as getting there, you imagine that you're already there, which consequently pulls your behavior in line.

If you're like me and have trouble truly believing in yourself, then [[act your way into beliefs which reinforce your actions]]. Alternatively, you can also [[choose courage over confidence]], which in the same stroke, allows you to positively build evidence towards confidence.

A vital part of performing is an athelete's self image. They say you don't "rise to the occasion", but "fall to the level of your training". While true, if the athlete has a strong, positive self image, worked intelligently, and has a strategic game plan, they indeed can rise to the occasion. 

For those still working towards a better self image, it's going to be a conscious process. You must [[constantly decide to be, not try]]. When you're "being", and you won't be perfect the first, fifth, or 500th try, you will still inch closer and closer to embodiments and characteristics of that particular identity. This is because [[the self image regulates like a thermostat]]. Your [[acts reinforce beliefs]] and this further cycles into a more positive or more negative self. image.

It all begins consciously - [[nothing has meaning except for the meaning you assign it]]. This sense of presence gives folks permission to see that our futures are not set and our past doesn't lock us in amber.

We can "talk" to ourselves over and over again, but similar to other authors, Mark talks about how one communicates with their subconscious. He makes the case that [[the subconscious has no body so imagination is reality]], which means you can essentially play and replay any scenario in your conscious mind. Your subconscious won't be able to tell the difference because [[vivid imagery produces a real stimulus]]. This allows for repetitions that you can't achieve with high frequency in reality.

To better enact change, Mark details how to [[iteratively challenge your beliefs]], and outlines the [[7 steps of winning beliefs]].

When we talk a little bit longer term, those who eventually do great things have reasonably high expectations of theselves. In order to survive the ups and downs, they have to [[match commitment with expectancy]], which gives them staying power.

In the short-term, you must actively practice:

1. [[make goals a reality and understand the process]]
2. [[practice in a way that strengthens your self image]]
3. [[close the gap between training and performance]]
4. [[know your optimal emotion functioning zone]]
5. [[create a pre performance ritual]]
6. [[create a pressure log helps identify how to tune inward]]
7. [[create daily intention by staying present and aware]]

One could say all this shit is super complicated, and the best course of action is to stay in the present. 

The first step is to see that [[observing that your attention is elsewhere is coming back to the present]]. It's like catching yourself falling asleep as your head is about to hit the seat - "ah! I'm awake! I'm here." If you're thinking about what might happen or what has happened, your'e really not paying attention to what's going on in front of you.

I find that [[focusing on breathing brings me back to the present]].

---

There are [[universal feelings when one gets into the zone]].

Also, you should [[care about the essence and the process]] not just the end. How you get there is somewhat important, especially for long term commitments.

Developing a system of [[mental management is your most important skill as a bjj athelete]]. Also, it helps to [[clear your baggage and be unencumbered]].
