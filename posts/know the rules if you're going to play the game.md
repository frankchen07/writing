### know the rules if you're going to play the game

As per the IBJJF, the rules are meant to be referenced for a "good fight". 

Good referees will never interrupt moving bodies to reset a position. If they do, they will never reset in a submission. The attacker would instead get 2 points and they would reset to standing.

In the case that the attacker is attacking and instead comes to rest in a dominant position, then the attacker and defender would be reset to the center of the mat in the same position.

In the case where there is a double guard pull, if the referee does not check his watch, that means one competitor pulled before the other. If the referee is checking his watch, that means both competitors, in his/her view, pulled at the same time. In any case, it is to the benefit of whichever competitor who wants to win to get up and get on top. If they were the one who pulled guard first, then then would get on top. If they weren't the one who pulled guard, they would get points. 

In the case of an attacker and defender in an out of bounds situation:
- If the attacker goes out of bounds while trying to complete a submission and fails to do so, they get 1 advantage point and they get reset in the middle.
- If the attacker flees out of bounds while trying to complete a submission, then they get a penalty point.
- If the defender successfully defends a submission but goes out of bounds to do so, the attacker gets 2 points and they get reset in the middle.
- If the defender flees from a submission out of bounds, it is a DQ.

Stalling calls last 20 seconds.

If you pass the guard, get to mount, they turn to the back, you get your hooks, they turn to their stomach, you release your hooks, and then they turn back into mount, it's 3 for the guard pass, 4 for the mount, 4 for the back take, 4 for the back mount, and then 4 for the mount again. 

Sweeps only happen from guard, and takedowns only happen from standing. 
* If you shoot and get smashed but don't let grips go, then it's still "from standing" and if you take them down, 2 points. 
* If you shoot and get smashed but let grips go, and shoot again from knees, it's "from knees" and if you take them down, 0 points. It's not a takedown if it's from the knees.
- If you're in top side and I come up and get a single leg, it's not a "standing position" because it wasn't from guard. If you pull guard or I take your down, no points.

You may be in the leg saddle, but only the secondary leg is open to be attacked. Leg laces are not allowed.

If the competitors are in the half guard position and the top competitor has upper body control for 3 seconds, if the guy below them recovers, it's 1 advantage for the top guy. This does not apply for deep half, cut through, or lazy butterfly half. It applies for 3/4 mount and an active butterfly half with upper body control.

If the competitors are in the back position and the offensive competitor has one hook in for 3 seconds, if the defender gets out of the back positions, it's 1 advantage for the offensive competitor.
