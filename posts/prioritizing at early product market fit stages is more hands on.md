### prioritizing at early product market fit stages is more hands on

Many early product market fit PMs fall into the trap of relying too much on data, solving nice-to-have problems, and getting caught up in theory and not building. 

At the same time, don't always do everything your users ask. Make sure you deeply understand the problem at hand.

The primary goal is to make 10 customers deeply happy.

- Who are these customers? 
- Why are they here? 
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What's keeping them from quickly accomplishing what they want to accomplish?
- What major problem or frustrations do they have?

Once you have an understanding of that user, you can look to solving their frustrations.
