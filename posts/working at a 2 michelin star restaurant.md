### working at a 2 michelin star restaurant

Many have asked me how I scored an interesting opportunity like this with no experience. 

To that, I'd say eating at the restaurant multiple times certainly helped with menu familiarity and just loving the restaurant in general. Good communication, persistent follow up, and a heavy dose of luck was what sealed the deal.

The last time I ate at the restaurant, my partner was the one who asked our waiter for me to see if they would take on interns with no experience. Through that interaction, I got a business card, and the rest was an email and phone call.

I've transitioned through some careers multiple times, but this particular experiment has been the most radical one to date during [[the year of experimenting with careers]].
