### focus on execution, not the outcome

"In fighting, in order for a "winner" and a "loser" to exist, the fight itself must first have completely ceased to exist. In this way, victory and defeat have nothing at all to do with combat. They are actually mutually exclusive things, never coming into contact with each other at all. So, a warrior should not be concerned with outcomes, but with execution, and with being. Not training to win, but training to fight at the highest conceivable level."

~ David Weintraub (CJJ Veteran)
