### mental commitment leads to confidence and body commitment

A lack of commitment in the mind causes indecision in the body, which leads to poor outcomes. Assertive and decisive is better than inaction and waiting. 

Put your mind in the bicep. Put your mind in the body and move from the thinking mode to the trusting mode.

Confidence is knowing what to do when you don't know what to do.
