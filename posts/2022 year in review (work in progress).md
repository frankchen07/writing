This will be my first year-in-review inspired by [David Perell's year-in-review](https://perell.com/essay/annual-review-2021/) and his writing. The year of 2022 was full of themes and experiments that I'd like to reflect on and use as feedback as to how to structure 2023. 

I've slotted some higher level categorizations so this piece is a little bit more organized, but I'll explicitly highlight some action items you might want to experiment with yourself.

### work - experiment 1

Like I said before, the year of 2022 was the year of exploration. For the past 4 years since 2018, I fell into the rabbit hole of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I jumped over from the field of digital healthcare, with a background in data science and product analytics. My aim in 2018 was not only to hop industries but also move from analytics to product management. For anyone curious on how to make this particular move or any career move in general, the premise is just to "start being the role" in the smallest capacity that you can. I wrote a [short tweet thread](https://twitter.com/fronkfeeds/status/1550239848283287552) about this.

From 2018 to 2022, I spent 4 years at a small but influential startup called Gitcoin, a masthead of the Ethereum space and a champion of open source public goods. There, I worked in a data and product capacity, and was able to achieve the jump that I had imagined back in 2018. I left Gitcoin in January 2022 because I felt like I got comfortable. I had settled into a very familiar rhythm in the past 6-7 years and I wanted to break out of it. 

The first experiment was doing product consulting and freelance work instead of a full-time job. Back in 2021, I had started an LLC in preparation to work in such a capacity. It was really a structure setup to serve in multiple DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations, but just say "multiple organizations"), but in hindsight, what I essentially was freelance contract work. I come in, do a chunk of work or consult, get paid, and leave.

Taking this plunge was an uncomfortable one. Your next paycheck is not guaranteed. Your success or death is completely reliant on the quality of your work, but also your skill at sourcing clients. Benefits? Healthcare? Payroll for yourself? Financial planning? Bookkeeping? Taxes? Sorry bucko, all up to you.

It was here that I learned that the structure of your freelance business and the content that you work on matters. Product management as a contract or consulting service doesn't work out well because part-time work doesn't allow enough context gathering on a product. A product is a full-time thing. Engineers, designers, and writers can work on discrete portions of projects, but product people can't, unless you're highly experienced and have the necessary skillset to advise but not execute. If you are one of those rare people, then your true skillset is your judgment, which is a reputation that is hard to attain. 

You might be asking, "okay ... who the fuck cares - why does this matter to me?" It matters in three ways. 

1. I always wanted to "do my own thing". It was actually doing it that exposed me to all the experiences of running a business. It was 10x easier for me too because I didn't have any employees, and I still found it annoying. I settled into a rhythm, but it still felt like a fuck ton of overhead that I didn't want to deal with. In order to truly understand what something is like, you just have to do it. This theme comes up again later in the year.

2. I had a realization that I was still selling my time for money. Doing this was essentially a W-2 full-time job with more flexibility, but now I had to do a bunch of bookkeeping, hire a CPA, fuck around finding benefits, and deal with business fees. "Working" and "consulting" is trading time for money. "Creating value and then selling that value to customers" - that's a business. The latter is difficult, feels more uniquely satisfying to me, and it provides better leverage. In a way, I didn't really have a business that worked. I'm not afraid to admit that experiment failed.

3. Our tax structure is uniquely set up to benefit businesses and the people that run them. I'm not qualified to talk about this, but there were hours and hours of conversations with my CPA as to how to tax-optimize my LLC and income. I think everyone should try and start their own thing at some point. Regardless of outcome, you'll learn something.

### jiujitsu - experiment 2 

In March of 2022, as my consulting business started winding down, I took a hard look at some of the things I already cared about and really wanted to do. This was the beginning of the second experiment.

The primary obsession was jiujitsu. I had started as a timid hobbyist about five years ago, and with every year, I upped the amount of training that I did. After a while, I caught the competition bug and started training almost everyday, sometimes twice a day in order to accelerate my growth. On my own, I would study film in my off time and investigate my own competition performances to shore up gaps in my own game. I even went as far as to hold memberships at two different gyms so I could encounter an increased variety of styles.

Jiujitsu is one of those special sports where the best of the best are not gate kept from the normal population. It wouldn't be an easy thing to set up a 1v1 game with Michael Jordan or any number of current NBA superstars. But jiujitsu? There's the opportunity to train with the best if you're at the right gym. Every gym has em'.

I asked myself, what would it be like if I trained like a semi-professional and competed as much as possible? 

With the extra time I had, I went full-bore, upped training to 8-9 times a week and competed 1-2 times a month. I was making great progress but never seemed to compete very well. My mindset was objectively weak and my performance was spotty. This led me down a long rabbit hole of reading every book I could find on [sport psychology and mindset](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/map-of-content-(mindset)). Looking back, it was a pretty pedantic way of learning, but in some sense, it had to be done.

Competing and doing well consumed me, and it started to ruin the experience and the original fun I had sought out in the training room. I went so far to classify years of hard work, my performance, and my own view of myself as absolute trash. It was not pretty. There were tears, frustrations, and complaints, many of which I tried to keep to myself. My response was to re-read psychology books, re-up my training time, and basically hit it harder. The results were still disappointing and to this day, it's been a barrier I've been unable to break.

I'm not one to give up, but there comes a time to re-evaluate what's been working and what hasn't. I realized that my social media habits on Instagram was a strong mimetic effect on my desires to compete and win, drowning out what I felt was my strongest capability, which was more akin to pursuing highly technical jiujitsu and maybe some teaching / coaching. I have yet to see how this develops, but I will admit that I did struggle with this on a daily basis.

As the year closes out, I've definitely taken a breath and given myself a little bit of breathing room. The harshness of the year and the constant self-battering did take its toll. I don't know where I've landed on competition. Perhaps there's another approach, but I do anticipate continuing to do them in the spirit of constant improvement. I'll have to learn how to manage my expectations and disappointments better, but that's all part of the game.

The biggest learning was that I'm my worst and harshest critic. This was a defining year where my own psychology consistently put me in mental traps that I could not escape without help. There is an attitude change somewhere in there, an approach on expectations and an understanding of my own limitations that's probably needed, but at the moment, I don't wish to overthink it.

I already know I won't quit, ever. But perhaps I lost a sense of play and lightheartedness about the whole thing somewhere along the way. 

A quote that I made for myself is where I'll leave this: "just show up, be purposeful about it, but never leave your curiosity and sense of play at the door." 

### cooking - experiment 3

The last major experiment in 2022 occurred shortly after my 9th anniversary in June. My partner and I ate at Birdsong, a two-Michelin starred restaurant, for our third time.

I had always been curious about the culinary world. Back in 2011, I had sought a stage at the world renowned Spago, but didn't end up taking the job they offered me because I needed to finish university. The itch remained throughout the decade, and I scratched that itch by doing side projects, like starting an experimental supper club in 2019. Unfortunately, the club died during COVID, but the itch remained. 

After dining at Birdsong June of 2022, I got my hands on the business card of the chef de cuisine. Several emails and a phone call later, I was locked in for a month-long stage. I think the differentiating factor that helped me get a foot in the door was because I was familiar with the menu and displayed a recurring interest in it. My actions spoke the truth. 

I've detailed it at hand in several [Twitter threads](https://www.frank-chen.com/posts/working-at-a-2-michelin-star-restaurant), but one thing was clear. It was rare for someone to jump into a 2-Michelin star restaurant and be able to not massively fuck it up. I was proud to hear that at the end of my stage, I produced net positive outcomes for the restaurant, both in prep and also the line.

There was a dark side. I knew that doing restaurant work full-time at my age and frequency would absolutely destroy me. I was offered several options for employment at the restaurant and I eventually decided to do it part-time, in order to have enough time and space to focus on my consulting business as well.

The whole point was to experience something different even though I had read first hand about the hardships of the kitchen. At this point, I had talked to mid-life career changers, chefs who went to business school, IT workers who turned to the kitchen, and the hundreds of cooks and chefs across the internet forums who "regretted or loved working in the industry." For the longest time, I allowed these thoughts to permeate and inform my opinion as second hand experiences when in reality, only a first hand experience would do. 

The lesson here is that you don't know what something is like until you actually go off and do it. You have to live it, to feel the essence of what you're doing to really understand if it's something you're purely addicted to, or if it's a shit sandwich you're not willing to eat. Most times, it's not black and white, and well, that's what makes life colorful. 

The second lesson was about commitment. There were some days where I felt that taking the responsibility part-time was a mistake. Having one foot in and one foot out made me a somewhat unreliable worker at the macro level, even if I was pretty good off the bat with my work duties. With any craft, focus is necessary. Showing up and having good focus makes it easier to receive and ask for more responsibility. More responsibility means more learning. I stunted myself in this aspect by doing too many things.

Lastly, I learned that I have a "grass is greener on the other side" mentality. I knew that I would want time and space to do things outside of the kitchen - enhance my relationship, train jiujitsu, and upskill in my product consulting practice. When I was in the kitchen, there were times I was present, but at other times, I didn't want to be there. Similarly, when I wasn't in the kitchen, there were times when I felt useless, and the things I was doing were impractical and unproductive. It seems I just wanted what I couldn't have at the moment, and that was a frustrating outlook that I still observe to this day. Variety and focus just don't go hand in hand, especially because they're on opposite sides of the spectrum.

My last few days in the kitchen will end just before the new year. It's been an interesting ride, and it's an experience that will shape the years to come, whether or not I end up in food. 

### writing - experiment 4

Alongside all of this experimentation, 2022 was the year I really took to David Perell's line of thinking when it came to working in public, creating content, and building your own brand.

I do quite a bit of writing on my own for documentation purposes, but never seemed to find the right audience or platform to share it with. Immediately after leaving my full-time job, I had the time and space to start publishing on frank-chen.com. It wasn't publicized to a huge extent but I published working maps of content, concepts I was thinking about at the current moment, and thoughts that straight up were incomplete. People still found it, and to my surprise, it usually provided fodder for interesting conversations with strangers. You could say it increased the surface area for serendipity.

I anticipate continuing this long-running experiment and seeing where more niche topics take me. 

### depression & mental health

2022 was the also the year that I had the harshest and truest depression states I have ever experienced. The last time this happened was back in 2015, nearing the end of my graduate studies, where the gloom of New York and lack of friendships and meaningful work put me in a deep spiral. I had tried therapy briefly at university and after university, but it was a very short lived six to eight months of treatment. The minute I had a short-term fix, namely a new job to escape to, I decided the cost wasn't worth it and decided to stop.

I had a generally negative view of talk therapy. Learning to "cope" was infuriating, because that sounded like understanding and coming terms that you were sitting in your own filth. The acceptance just didn't seem right to me. Why should I accept that? No, fuck off. I want to dig into why I'm sitting in my own filth, why it keeps happening over and over again, to get to the root causes and figure out why I've been shitting my pants the whole fucking time. 

With the stoppage of consistent meaningful employment and into the unknown of freelancing, I jumped into what felt like an exciting time. I had good relationships, a friend network, and engaging hobbies, but again, something felt off. I had a consistent feeling of apathy. Some days, I still do. Anhedonia was my self diagnosis. I didn't have a desire to commit suicide, but if life ended for some supernatural reason, I'd be okay with it. There wasn't much to look forward to. 

My partner pleaded for me to find a therapist and also consider medication. My reaction to medication has always been that my condition was not due to a "lack of [medication]", so it seemed to reason that path wouldn't be the right one. I did give in and restarted therapy, this time with a therapist that had a more holistic, psychoanalytic view with a basis in dialectical behavioral therapy. It focused more on understanding my past behaviors, my upbringing, and some shadow work - instead of the common treatment of "learning how to cope".

Long story short, to me, asking for help was a huge step in my recovery. For those who feel like therapy hasn't produced results, try again. Understand that the first couple thousand dollars might be wasted trying to find the right fit but also the right approach. Things like this take time because humans are messy and have emotions. It takes time to untangle these things, and to find someone willing to work with you and for yourself to accept changes.

Above all, something my therapist is helping me do listen more closely to the signals that my body is telling me, instead of the rationalizations that occur inside my head. Coming from an analytical background, the tendency is to break everything down into black and white, right and wrong, pros and cons. Sometimes that feeling of dread comes from deep within your stomach and manifests as a tightness within your chest - that even though it's a "good opportunity", "good person", "the right choice", it just doesn't fucking feel right, and that should be information that goes into making your decision. 

FRANK - CREATE TRANSITION TO ENERGY AUDITS

I plan to do more of these types of these purposeful energy audits in the future. Matt Mochary and Lenny Rachitsky, some product leaders I follow, have recommended doing this type of energy audit on a micro and macro level. The micro level is asking yourself every hour on the hour - was that hour "green" or "red" in terms of energy. Do I feel more energized and excited, or do I feel depleted and dejected? Over time, aim to delegate away or stop doing things that are energy red, and do more of the things that are energy green. You can surmise how this will go at a broader level. Do the things you want to be doing and that give you energy, stop doing the things that you don't want to do and don't give you energy. Everything else will fall into place (hopefully).

### removing social media

This year, I've removed all social media from my phone and have kept a low information diet. From my mobile, I trashed Instagram, Messenger, Telegram, Signal, Google Chat, Google Meet, and Zoom. I never had the Facebook app downloaded and I had to keep WhatsApp because the desktop version doesn't work unless you link it to your mobile device. WhatsApp is currently sitting in a digital box labeled "fomo".

Earlier in the year, I removed the mobile apps in favor of accessing it through the Safari browser. I similarly check my email this way. No notifications and it adds an extra step - it makes you think twice about pulling out your phone and seeing what's going on. 

This time around, I've enabled content restrictions on my mobile phone as well. I no longer can access Instagram, Facebook, or Messenger from my Safari Browser. I've also downloaded an iOS app called "Intent". It kills the scrolling feed on Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Instagram and Facebook had already been blocked from a website perspective, so Intent in this case was really to kill my YouTube feeds. This way, anytime I show up to YouTube, it would be to specifically watch content I was subscribed to, or what I was searching. No more mindless clicking. 

The only benefit I've found to social media is to message my friends and those who prefer to stay on a particular platform. I message people on Instagram occasionally, but also Messenger. From here on out, all messaging is done through my laptop, on a browser. I use a Google Chrome Extension called "News Feed Eradicator" which again, nullifies all the social scrolling feeds on multiple apps. This way, when I do use Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, no feeds are shown. They remain purely messenger apps. 

News Feed Eradicator also nullifies the web version social scrolling feed on YouTube and LinkedIn, and has options for Twitter, Reddit, and Github. It has been fucking amazing for keeping a low information diet. 

Some vices remain. I have yet to browser block Reddit and Twitter on both my desktop and mobile phone, but I've never downloaded or used either app. I have to keep WhatsApp around because you're unable to use the desktop version of it if you delete the app. I shuttle it into a category labeled "fomo". The basic premise is "I don't want to see feeds. If it's important enough, then you'll message me through [platform] or you'll text me." 

Why all the shenanigans though? I learned that things like Instagram and Facebook have a powerful mimetic effect on me. The photos, videos, and reels had strong imprinting on influencing the things that I thought I wanted. It started leading me down paths that didn't give me energy, and I was constantly comparing myself to others. I suffered greatly because of this, and each instance of seeing what others had that I didn't lowered my gratitude and took me days to recover. 

Twitter and Reddit have served more as a news source and a place to search opinions and stories. There's probably some mimetic effect in play, but it's markedly less than the visual social apps. 

The solution for me is to full-stop discontinue using these products until I can manage my own psychology. Simple as that. 

### productivity?

I was lazy to use a service to batch unsubscribe my email from marketing crap, so anytime an email landed in my inbox that I didn't care to see anymore and it wasn't serving me, I manually unsubscribed from it, one by one, over time. My inbox is relatively quiet nowadays. I regularly reach inbox zero, but it's not a particular goal.

### learning to live, writing, entrepreneurship?

CREATING / ENTREPRENEURSHIP
1. worker and logistics - paid for your time
2. manager - paid for your time
3. performer - paid for your performance and content
4. creator - paid for your content
5. investor - paid for your judgment
- keep the entrepreneurial spirit and creator vibes
- the invisible manager in my head

WRITING & CREATING
- started writing and thinking in public at frank-chen.com, but distribution has been my difficulty
	- did a food blog, stopped
	- did a newsletter, stopped
	- did another newsletter, stopped
	- readership was my main goal, which meant I wasn't having fun

### 2023 and beyond?

- the midwit meme, having fun, do it because it's cool
