### focus your attention on the present

Feel the fear and do it anyway. Focus yourself back to the present. Pressure is anxiety about the future. Pressure is remember failures from the past. Emotions are your attention being fixated on something outside of yourself.

Instead, come back to yourself in the moment.

Know that you're here now, preparing for the future. Know that you're here now, learning from the past. Know that you're here now, performing in the present.
