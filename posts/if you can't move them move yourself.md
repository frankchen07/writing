### if you can't move them move yourself

This is the concept of whole body positioning.

Instead of muscling a position, how can you adjust your entire body to change the angle and continue your movement?

Is the position that you're in structurally stable? If you are stable, can you expand or contract to continue your movement?

Are you marking or grabbing? Grabbing, while stronger, can inhibit movement. Marking is weaker but it provides counterforce for your to move your own body into better positions.
