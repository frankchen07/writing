### map of content (product)

Here you'll find some thoughts revolving around the core tenants of product management, some of my learnings, and how I've approached my workflow.

#### standup & mortems

I've found that [[how you organize your day determines your day]], so I created a template for myself on how I would like to catch up with my own team.

Staying focused in today's working landscape is also a challenge. I'm looking to test Shreya's [[leverage neutral overhead (lno) framework]] to help prioritize execution tasks.

Use pre-mortems to expose product-killing "gotchas". Use post-mortems to figure out how you can do something better next time.

- [[premortems expose product killing gotchas]]
- [[postmortems help improve future iterations]]

#### conducting user interviews

One thing to constantly do is to [[consciously build product sense]]. The more you talk to your users, the more intuition you gain, and the better you're able to assess the underlying behaviors that take place.

Doing hundred of iterations with users has honed the process that I use when speaking with users. There's not really a hard format, but more so general concepts I adopt in order to really [[empathize with users during conversations]].

We do have to remember that [[customers don't usually know what they want]], so make sure to properly structure your conversations and synthesize your results afterward.

[Conducting research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtvSR8Q1MZ4) with your target market and target users is ridiculously important. The aim is to [[use research to discover, evaluate, and refine]], and [[use prototyping to map out a user experience]].

#### prioritization

After several years of just jumbled prioritization, I generally like to keep things minimal, and have come to the conclusion that [[prioritization should be simple]] but also unique to the problem at hand. Something to note is that [prioritization can be as much as a political problem as it is an analytical problem](https://www.mironov.com/pri-politics/), so be aware. 

It's also true that [[prioritizing at early product market fit stages is different]], so there's never really a one size fits all.

In [Lenny's Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/46ESEeVyHHA6sWE0AdfzTs?si=8a6cc8cc2f6747d4), Shreyas Doshi talks about his experiences with prioritizing work. He encourages us to [[minimize opportunity costs instead of pursuing returns on investment]].

I don't utilize any definite frameworks when I prioritize, but generally, I do like to organize my thinking around answering [[eigenquestions that eliminate large swathes of microdecisions]].

#### building product sense

Deconstruct products and ask targeted questions to [[consciously build product sense]].

#### getting alignment

Generally, [[misalignment is caused by folks talking past one another]]. Perk your ears up and listen to which level you're on and which level others are on.

#### building community

I've been reading some books about community, and I'm increasingly of the opinion that [[building community is another form of understanding users]].

#### web3 vs web2 product

I've been developing some thoughts revolving around [[trends in web3 product management]] as well as [[preparing for a future in web3 product]].

In web2, [[product management is about value and viability]]. This is a more or less solidified opinion by the Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG). I'll use this frame of view to make the case that web3 needs to move towards value and viability to reach it's full potential. But right now, [[web3 has been heavily focused on feasibility rather than usability]].

#### product reviews

I've written [[a product review of choice kingdom trust]], an IRA platform that is friendly to digital assets. For the time being, I'm still using them, but only because their customer service has been responsive. There's way too many shitty UI issues, random fees, inane paperwork processes that inch me closer to quitting them permanently. 

Since I've been investigating web3 wallets a little bit deeper, I've vocalized [[a product deconstruction of phantom wallet]], one of the more prominent wallets in the Solana ecosystem. This is just me making sure to [[consciously build product sense]].

#### random
