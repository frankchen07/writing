#### web3 vs web2 product

I've been developing some thoughts revolving around [[trends in web3 product management]] as well as [[preparing for a future in web3 product]].

In web2, [[product management is about value and viability]]. This is a more or less solidified opinion by the Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG). I'll use this frame of view to make the case that web3 needs to move towards value and viability to reach it's full potential. But right now, [[web3 has been heavily focused on feasibility rather than usability]].

#### product reviews

I've written [[a product review of choice kingdom trust]], an IRA platform that is friendly to digital assets. For the time being, I'm still using them, but only because their customer service has been responsive. There's way too many shitty UI issues, random fees, inane paperwork processes that inch me closer to quitting them permanently. 

Since I've been investigating web3 wallets a little bit deeper, I've vocalized [[a product deconstruction of phantom wallet]], one of the more prominent wallets in the Solana ecosystem. This is just me making sure to [[consciously build product sense]].

#### standup

I've found that [[how you organize your day determines your day]], so I created a template for myself on how I would like to catch up with my own team.

---

#### conducting user interviews

One thing to get really good at is talking to users often, because [[developing product sense is about user empathy and deconstructing products]].

We do have to remember that [[customers don't usually know what they want]], so make sure to synthesize your results afterward.

#### prioritization

After several years of just jumbled prioritization, I generally like to keep things minimal, and have come to the conclusion that [[prioritization should be simple]] but also unique to the problem at hand. 

It's also true that [[prioritizing at early product market fit stages is different]], so there's never really a one size fits all

---

#### building product sense

Deconstruct products and ask targeted questions to [[consciously build product sense]].

---

#### building community

I've been reading some books about community, and I'm increasingly of the opinion that [[building community is a legitimately valuable skill]].
