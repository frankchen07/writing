### the subconscious has no body so imagination is reality

When you create feel imagery and vision thoughts in your head, your subconscious focus creates ideas and thought patterns that you haven't had otherwise. Your physiology will also respond in kind.

Your belief creates a positive lead that your reality will catch up to.

"You become a winner the instant you decide to start living like a winner; then winning competitions and winning in life become possible. But first you must bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be by living in your new identity."

What you're really doing is activating the reticular activating system (RAS). The RAS tunes out distractions and is a gatekeeper to what gets allowed into our consciousness. 

Affirmations that translate to images and feel-imagery are the conscious ways we can activate the RAS and permanently change our subconscious.
