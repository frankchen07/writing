### encompass the 5 Ls of your sport

**Love.** For a performer, love is the most basic ingredient for success. Without love for your sport and those people who are important to you, you aren't living. You're only breathing. As Peggy Fleming, the former Olympic champion figure skater, said, the most important thing is to love your sport.

**Labor.** It is said that if you do what you love, you never work a day in your life. But there is no shortcut to success. Success is built upon dedication and hard work.

**Learn.** Frank Howard, the ex-big-league slugger, said the trouble with baseball is that by the time you learn how to play the game, you can't play it anymore. The same could be said for most other sports. Dan Fouts, the NFL Hall of Fame quarterback, compares an athlete's career with the scales of justice. "The left side of the scales is piled full of talent and the right side is piled with brains. When you begin your career, it's full of the physical and almost void of the mental," Fouts said. "Then as you get further along â€¦ the balance shifts to the mental side as your physical abilities deteriorate and your mental capabilities accelerate.

**Laughter.** Don't let competition kill your sense of fun. Part of the music of sports is laughter.

**Leave, or let go.** "I know that I'm never as good or bad as any single performance," Charles Barkley said.

In working with athletes, and all performers, I remind them that we don't know what the future holds for any of us. So why not act as if you're going to have a great future? Set your goals. Do the work. While positive thinking doesn't always work, negative thinking, unfortunately, almost always does.

Throughout this book we have talked about some of the world's best-known athletes. Most champions, however, aren't famous. They aren't written about in _Sports Illustrated_ or interviewed on ESPN; instead, they are all around us. They are everywhere we look.
