### the man who wins is the man who thinks he can

If you think you are beaten, you are
If you think that you dare not, you don't
If you'd like to win, but you think you can't,
It's almost certain you won't.

If you think you'll lose, you've lost
For out in the world you'll find
Success begins with a fellow's will.
It's all in the state of mind.

Life's battles don't always go
To the stronger or faster man;
But sooner or later the man who wins
Is the man who thinks he can.
