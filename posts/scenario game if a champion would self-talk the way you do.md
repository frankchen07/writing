### scenario game if a champion would self-talk the way you do

I currently have a lack of faith in myself because the evidence in the training room shows it. So how do I contend with the evidence? Take it as a learning and continue believing in myself? Is that the meaning of faith? 

Think of it this way. If the [insert amazing athelete's name here] talked like that to themselves, how good of an athlete do you think he'd be?
