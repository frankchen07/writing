### how to take an elegant out of office

Here's an out of office message that I use. I set up the message to be auto-sent to those looking for a response during the times I'm out.

Hey!

I'm currently out of office and completely away from my inbox, Thursday 07/26 to Sunday 08/05.

Any and all requests will have to wait until the 6th of August.

It's rather minimal. Most people would add a clause saying "if there is an emergency," but remember, the whole point of a vacation is to get away from everything. If there is an emergency, most likely it's with a person that has your personal-personal contact information, and they'll find a way to reach you. Everyone else can wait.
