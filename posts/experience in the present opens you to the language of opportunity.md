### experience in the present opens you to the language of opportunity

3. Quiet the conscious and trust your subconscious.

Try again, with no conscious effort to overtly control your improvements. Simply be in the moment and feel your body. Resist any kind of commands.

The process is an incredibly simple one. The important thing is to experience it. Don't intellectualize it. See what it feels like to ask yourself to do something and let it happen without any conscious trying. For most people it is a surprising experience, and the results speak for themselves.

It is almost impossible to feel or see anything well if you are thinking about how you should be moving. Instead, the feel-imagery in front of you provides the cues for your subconscious.
