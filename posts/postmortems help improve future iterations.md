### postmortems help improve future iterations

I'm still looking for a good format for postmortems.

1. Who and what are you grateful for and would like to show appreciation for?

2. Can you recall any processes or times were things were bumpy and didn't work out the way you intended?

3. What do we need to stop doing immediately?

Let's pick one priority that we can agree on and consciously work on this in the next sprint.
