### consciously build product sense 

Product sense can develop from the core fundamental processes of product management, which is understanding and fulfilling unmet user needs.

Building on fulfillling unmet user needs, we can also:

1. build empathy by observing users interacting with products, and deconstructing products

2. improve creativity by reframing the problem and constantly learning from great product thinkers and upcoming technology trends

During observation assess if the user is understanding what it is they're looking at. Get their thoughts right there, in the moment. Do they:

1. understand what the value proposition of the product is?
2. understand what actions they can immediately take? 

Some additional questions:

1. what's the experience of getting started or signing up?
2. how does this app explain itself in the first minute?
3. how easy to use was the app?
4. how did you feel while exploring the app?
5. did the app deliver on your expectations, where were you frustrated, where were you delighted?

Compare applications:

1. what's the value proposition?
2. what's the look and feel of the app?
3. how easy is it to discover and perform core actions?
4. did the app deliver on your expectations?

Some assumptions that Jules Walter has observed during his time at Slack:

1. users are time-crunched and distracted when they use your product
2. users bolt at the first sign of confusion
3. users are prone to information overload
4. context impacts decisions
5. what's the fucking point of your product? make this clear
