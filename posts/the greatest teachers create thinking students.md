### the greatest teachers create thinking students

The greatest teachers create students who can independently question "why" something works versus just following dogma. 

Students of today's jiujitsu curriculums should seek to understand why something works.

If it doesn't work, it will show itself in practice. 

When I teach, I'm always cautious to emphasize the concepts of why something might work. I implore anyone who learns from me to try what I'm teaching in live sparring and stress test it and adapt it for themselves. They may find that a move works better for them with slightly different positioning.

This is how we elevate the sport.
