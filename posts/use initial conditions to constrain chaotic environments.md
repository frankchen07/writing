### use initial conditions to constrain chaotic environments

Control chaotic environments by fine tuning your ability to control the initial conditions that give you the advantage in competition.

If you do not achieve your initial conditions, stay disciplined and restart the battle until you achieve your initial conditions. This is strategy and "your game", which combats passivity and the lack of a coherent strategy.

This means you don't accept any conditions that don't fulfill what you're looking for in the moment. This also means, "fuck their BJJ".

In the long term, this translates to gameness.
