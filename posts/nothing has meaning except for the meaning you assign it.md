### nothing has meaning except for the meaning you assign it

"When we are willing to see that our past isn't set in stone as if it's fossilized, we can revise the meaning behind unwanted experiences and free ourselves from the chains of our personal history."

This power of interpretation can work in our favor as well. Viewing events in the past as positive, empathetic, and good can heal wounds from the past that we have previously interpreted incorrectly or negatively.
