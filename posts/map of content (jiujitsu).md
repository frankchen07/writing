At 10th Planet San Mateo, we have in effect what we call a "burrito tax". If you're sparring with your partner and you get caught or catch someone with a [twister submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYZJ3EoSzj8&t=103s), the guy or gal who taps owes their opponent a burrito. Oh and also, wrist locks are tacos. Here are my current debts:

Here you'll find some concepts that have helped me through my continuing jiujitsu journey. I revisit these at different points and it almost always brings new perspective to my game and also to my life. I constantly update these, so stay tuned!

#### jiujitsu as a whole

What are we ultimately doing in jiujitsu?

From a technical standpoint, it's arguable that [[the isolation of limbs is what jiujitsu is all about]]. Jiujitsu does indeed transcend technical control and ability though. It exercises self-mastery, spirituality, ego control, strength, flexibility, mental fortitude, and work ethic. I could go on, but the general summary is that jiujitsu can affect you in so many positive ways. 

From a personal standpoint, [[everything you do in jiujitsu should be an expression of you]]. This is just like bboying as a form of expression. If you blurred the faces of noteworthy dancers and jiujitsu athletes, you can still tell who is who purely based on how they move, the moves they use, and the tempo they take. That is the expression of essence. So, [[play your game because no one else is going to be better than you at it]]. This advice trascends the mat. Do your own thing and don't worry about everyone else.

At some point in your journey, you will begin to understand the ethos of "[[each one teach one]]" - a concept that I experienced in my days of bboying that I have yet to carry forth in my jiujitsu journey. "Each one teach one" perpetuates the cycle of responsible mentorship. Someone took the time and patience to bring you from a naive white belt to a limb-controlling, strangle-inducing monster. It is only right that when you are ready, you pass the knowledge along so new grapplers can embark on their own journey and we can level up the sport together.

#### knowing the rules

You should [[know the rules if you're going to play the game]]. This is a set of notes from an IBBJF rules seminar that was held at Caio Terra Academy. 

Just reading the rulebook is actually not enough. There are alot of "gotcha" situations and technical definitions that really only come to light when you're in a particular situation. If you want to play the game, know the rules, because there will come a day when you need that one point to win your match.

It's a pretty basic concept really. If you're competing in IBJJF matches, know those rules. ADCC? EBI? Something else? Give it a read. Know what submissions are legal and illegal. Know the point system. Know what happens when you go out of bounds. Defend yourself at all times.

#### training and learning

To progress in jiujitsu, you need to know how to learn, because the learning [[process is understanding that everyone learns differently]]. You will definitively have your own path. The faster you understand and come to terms with that, the faster you will seek and master your own self.

When I'm learning, I look to [[shuttle learnings into concepts and systems]], and when I'm teaching, I keep in mind that [[the greatest teachers create thinking students]].

When training new movements, [[train under constrained environments]]. This allows you to get multiple repetitions of a move in a specific position so you spend the majority of a roll's time perfecting new movements. 

Get into bad positions sometimes. Put yourselef there and [[train with late stage escapes]], both for yourself and for your partner. It will allow you to develop late-stage defenses that are critical in high-level matches.

Finally, for competitors - [[training habits are competition habits]]. Performance that outranks what you do in the training room is rare and generally is an exception. While you can rise to the occasion, the reality is more that you fall to the level of training. Make sure your baseline level of training encompasses competition habits.

#### the mental side

I've went deep on some sport psychology books to learn a little bit about mental performance. Many of these concepts do link to my [[map of content (mindset)]], but overall you'll find some topics here that I've accumulated.

To start, [[the way you show up on the mats matters]]. Your attitude is infectious and affects others. If it's up, you'll inspire. If it's down you'll drag. Inspire, don't drag.

You're going to get wrecked in the process of becoming a competent jiujitsu athlete. Don't despair when you roll with higher level athletes because [[approaching higher level players is a mental challenge]]. Naturally, there will be a skill gap, but [[do not start yourself at a deficit]] and go into a roll or competition with a defeatist attitude. That's a surefire way to tank your perfromance because [[the subconscious is where true performance lies]].

You're also going to get stuck in your progress. There are highs, lows, and plateaus. You'll naturally move past them, but switching it up can offer methods of getting unstuck. My best advice here is to do something different - [[aim to perceive what you have not perceived to get unstuck]].

Above all, don't quit, because [[a hopeful mindset keeps one in the pocket]], and the longer you're in the pocket, the more benefits you'll reap.

### movement

Let's talk about movement. Click around on some of the concepts that have helped me get unstuck. I revisit these concepts at different points in my journey because they consistently hold different meanings every time I revisit them. This is partly because my jiujitsu game is a fluid, dynamic entity. It's constantly changing. My life is also constantly changing, so even my interpreation is different on each visit. That to me, is beauty.

* [[constant movement is better than being static]]
* [[create movement if you're stuck]]
* [[if you can't move them move yourself]]
* [[movement makes weight shifts which opens opportunities to move limbs]]
* [[the whitespace is just as important as the blackspace]]
* [[utilize all 360 degrees of movement in 3 planes]]
* [[you don't want a 1 to 1 move tradeoff, you want an n to 1 tradeoff]]
* [[jiujitsu conditioning stretching rehab meditation]]

Contrary to popular belief, humans have five limbs. The [[use of your head is the fifth limb]].

Grips are very important for imposing your game because the start of any competitive jiujitsu match is where the most chaos occurs. The best competitors [[use initial conditions to constrain chaotic environments]] and are the first to implement their game. In order to achieve this, [[dominating the grip fight means you dominate the initial entry]], and that sets you up to achieve end-game positions.

One of the tougher battles in jiujitsu is how to better spot and take advantage of opportunities. It will be different for everyone. For msyelf, the best results have come from relaxing my over-analytical mindset and just flow. That is not the say there are concepts you can utilize:

- [[pair offensive actions on the offbeat]]
- [[real threats cause reactions which sets up attack chains]]
- [[take what they give you]]
- [[the faster you can get to offensive cycles the more you win]]
- [[more opportunities are found in the pocket]]
- [[cultivate a fail opportunity mindset to continue the action]]
- [[don't be satisfied with only escaping]]
