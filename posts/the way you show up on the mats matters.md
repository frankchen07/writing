### the way you show up on the mats matters

The way you show up on the mats matters.

When you're down or not feeling it, your attitude will be infectious, and it affects the people around you. Winners and champions want to stick with winners and champions. 

Have a champion mindset. Bring up everyone around you, even if you're the "worst" in the room. 

When you are under fire, if you remain calm, composed, and unemotional, that will be infinitely more useful than panicking. There is an element of trust when it comes to having the technical ability to remain calm and composed. 

As a mindset, your ideal desire is to express your purest jiujitsu.
