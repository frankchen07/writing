### iteratively challenge your beliefs

1. What is the inner voice saying, and what belief does that point to?
2. How is that belief holding you back?
3. What belief can I adopt instead that would empower me to do great things?
4. Repeat.

Your subconscious ranks experiences based on emotion.

Poor self-image is made worse by anchoring mistakes with intense emotion, so look at things unemotionally. Reinforce positive self-image by using emotional weight to good performances to being "like you". 

Additionally, use positive reinforcement in the training room as a coach.
