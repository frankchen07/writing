### visualization and feel imagery is the language of the subconscious

Visualize in the first-person.

Your self-image and physical body cannot tell the difference between what happens and what is vividly imagined. When watching jiujitsu instructionals, visualize the feeling of being there in the first person point of view and feel out the sequence. The subconscious mind moves you to do whatever the conscious mind is picturing. You can similarly see how giving positive commands gives clearer instruction to the subconscious.
