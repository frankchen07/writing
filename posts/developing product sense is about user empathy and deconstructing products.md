### developing product sense is about user empathy and deconstructing products

Product sense is the skill of consistently being able to craft products that have an intended impact on their users.

1. Empathy to the user by observing people interacting with products and deconstructing them.
2. Creative solutions.

Some examples:

* iPhone was built on the insight that people value aesthetics and functionality. The smartphone became personal.
* Gmail responded to low storage quotas, poor search, and related messages separated.
* Superhuman responded to fast email workflows to limit distractions.

To build empathy, try some of these questions:

1.  What do you think the purpose of this product is? Who do you think its for? This will give you a sense of how effective your product's landing page is. It also gives you ideas for words to describe your product that resonate with people.
2.  Now that you're in the product, what actions do you want to take? This will help you understand which features are easy to discover and how clear your product's navigation and calls to action are.
3.  What are you thinking right now? How does that make you feel? I tend to ask this at every new step the user lands on, because people tend not to notice their self-talk and feelings otherwise.

Things to note:

1.  People are time-crunched and distracted when they use your product. They might not read labels or text and might not be willing to spend even a few seconds to figure out what to do next. Pick the right defaults and use visual design and cues to make primary actions obvious (e.g. prominence, lack of distractions).
2. People will drop out of a product flow as soon as they feel confused or nervous that they might be doing something wrong. Make sure labels are unambiguous and contrast options appropriately.
3. Don't give people too much information at once, because once they feel overwhelmed, they tend to leave. For example, we ran pricing page experiments at Slack and saw increases in purchases when we moved some of the information on the various purchase options behind a dropdown list.
4. Context impacts decisions. Use tools like comparisons, contrasting, and social proof to make it easier for users to make a decision.
5.  Make sure the goal of your product and possible actions are clear to users.

Deconstructing products:

1.  What's the experience of getting started or signing up?
2.  How does this app explain itself in the first minute?
3.  How easy to use was the app?
4.  How did you feel while exploring the app?
5.  Did the app deliver on your expectations?

Some of the product design choices become more salient and it's easier to get hints of the product's strategy.

Observe your own frustrations and delights!
