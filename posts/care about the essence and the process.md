### care about the essence and the process

From Caio Terra, "when you're in competition class, I want you to have pride. If you don't have pride, you won't fight for position. I don't care if you lose. I care if you don't truly fight."

You might win or your might lose. The end really doesn't matter. But what matters is how you got there. 

If you won and you exhausted yourself, great.

If you lost and you exhausted yourself, still great - you gave it your all and left nothing to doubt.

If you won and you didn't exhaust yourself, you're ahead of the curve.

If you lost and you didn't exhaust yourself, you fucked up.

Be the first three, leave no doubt.
